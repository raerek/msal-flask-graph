Python Flask App utilizing Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL), Microsoft Azure Active Directory and Microsoft Graph

This code accompanies articles written by Mel Hall in which we create a Flask Web App.

Authentication code is based on https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-webapp

The app asks a user to log in using MSAL for authentication to request a token for accessing the Microsoft Graph API (a unified API for accessing all things Microsoft 365).
We shall make several API calls, retrieving our profile information, OneNote pages and create a Incident Management Bot which can create and manage Teams Channels. 

In addition our app will provide functionality to download our OneNote pages as Markdown.


## Instructions for Use

- Clone the repo.
- Complete the `app_config.py` section. Setup will involve app configuration on Azure Active Directory. Detailed instructions will appear on the article.
- `$ flask run --host=localhost --port=5000`
